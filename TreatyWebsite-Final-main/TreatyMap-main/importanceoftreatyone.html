        Id for the title to have a background and positioned in the center
        The default text color is not visible on the image as it is a light color
        At first i tried to just make the text color the dark color to make it visible on the image
        However when testing the site for accessibility, when you disable images this text is not visible
        as it is the same color as the background, so instead i decided to have a dark background behind
        the text to make it visible on the image and when you disable images you do not see this background
        at all and only see the lighter text color.

        Treaty One played a quite important role in the relation between the
        Canadian government and the indigienos people. Treaty One was the first
        treaty signed, setting up the stage for other treaties to be signed
        later. It was the first example of a agreement between Canada and
        indigenous people, and proved that negotiations and agreements could be
        made, to benefit the both.
