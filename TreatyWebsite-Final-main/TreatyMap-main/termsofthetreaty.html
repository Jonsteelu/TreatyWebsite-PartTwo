        At first i tried to just make the text color the dark color to make it visible on the image
        However when testing the site for accessibility, when you disable images this text is not visible
        as it is the same color as the background, so instead i decided to have a dark background behind
        the text to make it visible on the image and when you disable images you do not see this background
        at all and only see the lighter text color.
